# Cycloidal drives

Cycloidal drives are a type of **speed reducer** ⚙️. They are typically attached to electric motors to significantly **reduce their speed**. For instance, the motor shaft spins much faster than the output, meaning it might take 48 revolutions of the motor shaft for the cycloidal disc to complete just one revolution. These drives are capable of producing **large torque** 💪, making them suitable for applications like rotating heavy robotic arms or even allowing larger drives to lift themselves.  

At the **heart** ❤️ of a cycloidal drive, you'll find an **eccentric nut** mounted onto the motor shaft. This nut plays a crucial role in positioning a disc with a **cycloidal profile** slightly **off-center** 🔄 by half a millimeter.

### How Cycloidal Drives Work: The Core Mechanism

*   When the motor starts to spin, the eccentric nut forces the cycloidal disc to **shift in and out**.
*   **Cylindrical pins** are positioned around the disc.
*   As the disc is forced inward, it **meshes with these pins**.
*   Upon engaging a pin, the disc **rotates slightly and then disengages**. This continuous engagement and disengagement with the pins, driven by the eccentric motion, causes the disc to revolve slowly.

### Torque Amplification and Transfer

The cycloidal disc is the direct **source of amplified torque**. However, because the disc inherently **wobbles** 🤸‍♂️, it doesn't connect well to external structures directly. To effectively utilize this torque, a set of **load pins and a load plate** are essential.

*   **Load pins** are inserted into specific holes within the cycloidal disc.
*   Together with the load plate, a **nylon spacer** is inserted to **constrain the load plate at the center** 🎯.
*   As the cycloidal disc wobbles and revolves, it **pushes against the load pins**, which then transfer the amplified torque to the load plate.
*   To keep the load plate in place while allowing it to rotate freely, a **thrust bearing** 🌟 is positioned between the load plate and the drive's cover.

### Design Stages of a Cycloidal Drive

The source breaks down the design of such a cycloidal drive into **four main stages** ✨:

1.  **First Stage: The Casing** 🏠
    *   **Purpose 1: Holding Pins**
        *   It holds **three-millimeter pins** in place.
        *   These pins are spaced closely to ensure the drive remains **compact**.
        *   The casing has **49 bores** to slot these pins in, ensuring enough space for the cycloidal disc to mesh effectively.
    *   **Purpose 2: Motor Attachment**
        *   The stepper motor is attached to the casing using **four internal bores**.
    *   **Purpose 3: External Attachment**
        *   **Four threaded bores** on the outside allow the casing to be attached to external structures.
    *   **Purpose 4: Cover Attachment**
        *   Threads along the rim of the casing allow the cover to be **screwed in**, contributing to the drive's compactness by eliminating the need for additional threaded bores for the cover.

2.  **Second Stage: The Cycloidal Disc** 💿
    *   This disc features a **special cycloidal profile** that enables its unique rotational motion as it meshes with the pins.
    *   It has **five large bores** where the load pins are inserted. These bores are crucial as they push the load pins when the disc wobbles and rotates.
    *   In the center of the disc, there is a **bearing** that allows it to rotate freely around the eccentric nut.
    *   The eccentric nut, its bearing, and the cycloidal disc are all mounted onto the motor shaft.

3.  **Third Stage: Load Pins and Load Plate** 📌🍽️
    *   **Load Pins**:
        *   Their diameter is precisely calculated: the diameter of the large bores minus twice the eccentricity.
        *   They have **countersunk bores** and are secured by countersunk screws, which helps ensure **accurate positioning** and **minimizes backlash** 🎯.
    *   **Load Plate**:
        *   It has **10 threaded bores**: five are for the load pins, and the other five are for connecting to external structures.
        *   To restrict **vertical motion** ⬆️⬇️, a thin flange along its periphery holds a thrust bearing. When the cover is closed, it pushes down on this thrust bearing, constraining the load plate's vertical movement.
        *   To restrict **axial motion** ➡️⬅️, a bearing and a nylon spacer in the middle are used.

4.  **Fourth Stage: The Cover** 🛡️
    *   The cover has **threads on its side** allowing it to be screwed into the casing, which helps keep the entire cycloidal drive as **compact as possible**.
    *   Underneath the cover, there is sufficient space to hold and **secure a thrust bearing**.
    *   Additional **slots on top** of the cover provide an anchor for tools, making it easy to screw the cover in tightly 🛠️.
    *   The cover secures all internal components and **protects the cycloidal drive from the environment** 🌐.
